                    <h3>A Story of Dedication, Passion, and Innovation</h3>
                    <p>In May 2015, the Math Alliance Club, led by Jonathan Doane, embarked on a mission to give back to the Mathematics Department at SUNY Potsdam. The result was a stunning icosahedron sculpture, symbolizing both mathematical beauty and the collective effort of a passionate group of individuals. This project stands as a testament to the power of dedication, innovation, and community collaboration.</p>

                <p>An excerpt from an FY 100 student at SUNY Potsdam, as reported to me by Dr. Joel Foisy in September of 2018:
                    <br><br>
                    <em>"Above is a picture [not included, here] of me with the icosahedron outside of Carson Hall.  Its role is to remind us that mathematics professors and students of SUNY Potsdam are held to the highest standard they can be held to.  It’s been around since only 2015, and I don’t know if that’s enough time for it to have given anyone else inspiration.  What I do know, however, is that it inspired me.  During my first visit to this campus in 2016, I noticed this.  I went up and read the associated marker.  I don’t know what it was, but something about it struck me.  Before, I was considering many colleges.  A lot of my friends were going to UB, Binghamton, or Corning Community College.  I would be the only one here if I chose Potsdam.  From the moment I read that sign, I knew that this would be my first choice."</em>
